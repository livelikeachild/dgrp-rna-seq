# This is an example of the batch structure for DGRPseq projects
# Make sure to remove ALL comment lines (those starting '#') BEFORE using this file!
# The file should contain a row for each library to process in this batch
# Each row should have 6 tab-delimited columns:
# 1) Full library name (everything before the .fastq.gz in the file name)
# 2) Sample ID (there can be multiple libraries for the same sample if it was resequenced)
# 3) Flowcell ID
# 4) Lane number
# 5) Barcode
# 6) Sequencing date
# A typical way to organize batches is to have a separate batch for each flowcell
# You should edit this file in an editor that will not change the linebreak style
# for example whatever program you use to edit scripts
# If you edit the file in Excel, make sure to change it back to Unix linebreaks
# Several example lines are shown below
# !!! Make sure to remove ALL comment lines (from this one up!) before using this in your analysis !!!
